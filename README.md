# BitTorrent Client in Python 🐍

A lightweight, asynchronous BitTorrent client implemented in Python. This project demonstrates the core functionality of the BitTorrent protocol, including peer communication, piece management, and file downloading.

## Features 🌟
- **Asynchronous I/O**: Built with `asyncio` for high-performance peer communication.
- **Multi-File Support**: Handles both single-file and multi-file torrents.
- **Piece Management**: Efficiently manages and validates downloaded pieces using SHA-1 hashes.
- **Tracker Support**: Communicates with HTTP trackers to discover peers.
- **Rich Progress Tracking**: Real-time download progress with the `rich` library.

## How It Works 🛠️
1. **Parse Torrent File**: Extracts metadata (e.g., trackers, piece hashes, file structure).
2. **Connect to Trackers**: Retrieves a list of peers sharing the file.
3. **Peer Communication**: Establishes connections with peers to request and download pieces.
4. **Piece Validation**: Verifies downloaded pieces using SHA-1 hashes.
5. **File Assembly**: Combines downloaded pieces into the final file(s).

## Getting Started 🚀
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bittorrent-client.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the client:
   ```bash
   python main.py /path/to/your.torrent
   ```

## Example Usage 📂
```bash
python main.py ubuntu-22.04.torrent
```
